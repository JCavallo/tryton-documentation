How to get Help
===============

Mailing List
------------

tryton@googlegroups.com

Most of the tryton community follows this mailing list. You will usually be
able to find people willing to help you, provided you follow some simple rules:
 * Use english. There are language specific mailing lists, and posting in
   spanish or french on the standard mailing list will irritate and pollute
   those who do not understand the language.
 * Be descriptive. Do not hesitate to give plenty of details on your problem.
   People will not be able to help you if the only thing they read is "I have a
   problem".
 * Follow the Netiquette_. At the very least, be polite and avoid top-posting.

IRC (Chat)
----------

freenode #tryton

IRC is a great way to get support from the tryton community. People are usually
responsive, and willing to help. Again, some rules are necessary for it to work
properly:
 * Do not copy-paste huge chunks of text in the chat, it is annoying and makes 
   it unreadable. Use an online temporary hosting for it like Pastebin_ is more
   convienent for everyone.
 * People on the chat have no way to know what you are wanting to do. Be
   exhaustive in your explanation. Explain what your are trying to do, and what
   it is that makes it not possible.
 * Understand that people in the chat may have other things to do. We try to
   help, but most of us are working and may not be immediately available. If
   no-one answers you after a few minutes (20 minutes), you should probably
   send an e-mail in the tryton mailing-list.
